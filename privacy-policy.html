        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Call2Pray ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our mobile application Call2Pray (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you understand how your information is used.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>Call2Pray does <strong>NOT</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
            <li>User accounts or login credentials</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or statistics</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            <li>Any data sent to remote servers</li>
            <li>Any data shared with third parties</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Permissions Used and Why</h2>
        <p>Call2Pray requires certain permissions to function properly. Here's exactly what each permission is used for:</p>

        <h3>📍 Location Permission (GPS)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why we need it:</strong> To calculate accurate prayer times based on your geographic location</li>
            <li><strong>How it's used:</strong> Your GPS coordinates are used <em>locally on your device only</em> to determine prayer times</li>
            <li><strong>What we do with it:</strong> Nothing. The location data never leaves your device</li>
            <li><strong>Can you use the app without it:</strong> No, accurate prayer times require your location</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🔔 Notification Permission</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why we need it:</strong> To send you prayer time alerts and reminders</li>
            <li><strong>How it's used:</strong> To display notifications before each prayer time</li>
            <li><strong>Can you control it:</strong> Yes, you can enable/disable notifications in Settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>⏰ Exact Alarm Permission (Android 12+)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why we need it:</strong> To ensure prayer notifications arrive at the exact scheduled time</li>
            <li><strong>How it's used:</strong> For precise prayer time alerts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🖼️ Display Over Other Apps Permission</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why we need it:</strong> To show the full-screen Adhan alert even when your phone is locked</li>
            <li><strong>How it's used:</strong> Allows the Adhan screen to appear over the lock screen and wake your device for prayer times</li>
            <li><strong>What we do with it:</strong> Only used to display the prayer time alert and play Adhan</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy note:</strong> This permission does not allow us to see or access any other apps or data on your device. It only lets our prayer alert appear on top of the lock screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Can you use the app without it:</strong> Yes, but the screen may not wake automatically when your phone is locked, and you may miss prayer times</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>📱 Sensors (Compass/Magnetometer)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why we need it:</strong> For the Qibla compass feature</li>
            <li><strong>How it's used:</strong> To detect phone orientation and calculate direction to Mecca</li>
            <li><strong>What we do with it:</strong> Sensor data is processed locally; nothing is stored or transmitted</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>

            <li><strong>User preferences:</strong> Settings like Adhan selection, calculation method, dark mode</li>
            <li><strong>Last known location:</strong> Cached to reduce GPS battery usage</li>
            <li><strong>Prayer time cache:</strong> Pre-calculated times to work offline</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Reverse geocoding:</strong> Converting GPS coordinates to city/country names (first time only)</li>
            <li><strong>That's it.</strong> No analytics, no tracking, no ads, no data collection.</li>

        <h2>9. Security</h2>

            Since all data stays on your device and nothing is transmitted to servers, your data is as secure as your device is. We recommend:

        </p>

        <h2>11. Open Source & Transparency</h2>
